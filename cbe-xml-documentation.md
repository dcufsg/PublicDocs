# The Data Structure of the National Folklore Collection *Main Manuscript Collection*

The *Main Manuscript Collection* is one of five major collections of folklore held by [Cnuasach Bhéaloideas Éireann/the National Folklore Collection](https://www.ucd.ie/irishfolklore/en/) (NFC), University College Dublin (UCD), and comprises 2,400 bound volumes of material collected since 1932. Full- and part-time collectors compiled the majority of these under the auspices of the Irish Folklore Commission (1935–1971). Approximately two thirds of the material is in Irish and it includes every aspect of the Irish oral tradition.

This collection is currently being digitsed as part of the Dúchas project by [Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge](http://www.dcu.ie/fiontar_scoilnagaeilge/) (FSG), Dublin City University, in conjunction with the NFC. The digitisation will produce (1) a collection of scanned images and (2) an XML data set that indexes and annotates the images. This document describes the data structure used in the XML data set.

## Introduction 

A similar process to digitise the NFC *Schools' Collection* (hereafter referred to as CBÉS) and *Photographic Collection* (hereafter referred to as CBÉG) was previously undertaken during the period 2013–2017, also under the auspices of the Dúchas project. The results of this work have been made publically available at [www.duchas.ie](https://www.duchas.ie) and are in the process of being archived for preservation by the [UCD Digital Library](https://digital.ucd.ie/).
